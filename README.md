# titanic-survival-pytorch

This notebooks serves as a pivot between me and the pytorch environment. I have heard a lot about pytorch being superior to tensorflow and I have decided to just play around with it. At the moment am a beginner in ML domain but I have somewhat experience with Keras. 

I have picked this fairly easy problem of titanic survival prediction and I will try to make a model from scratch to make predictions. Whatever code I have written here is 98% self written by reading the related documentations, the reason I am putting this here is I want people to learn to self learn, it is the hard way but it makes things easier in the future.

After using pytorch, I feel like it provides you the basic ingredients to cook food, you can make anything but it doesn't guarentee that your food will taste good, it's your responsibility.
